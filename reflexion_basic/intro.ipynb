    "\n",
    "> Introduced in the paper [‚ÄúReflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning‚Äù](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366), it enables language models to revise strategies after failed executions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Breaks out of LLM stagnation**: Without reflection, agents repeat the same errors.\n",
    "- **Enables self-improvement**: After failed generations, the agent *analyzes* its mistake and adjusts.\n",
    "- **More effective than retry loops**: Reflexion is *not* a retry‚Äîit‚Äôs learning within a session.\n",
