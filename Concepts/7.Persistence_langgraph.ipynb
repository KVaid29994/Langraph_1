    "# ðŸ§  Persistence in LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ What is Persistence?\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangGraph, **persistence** refers to the ability to **store and reload the graph state** between different executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essential for:\n",
    "- Long-running workflows\n",
    "- Error recovery\n",
    "- Human in the loop\n",
    "- Short term memory\n",
    "- Time travel\n",
    "- Stateful applications (e.g., agents that remember conversations)\n",
    "- Distributed processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Without persistence, all state is lost once execution stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’¾ Why is Persistence Needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph maintains a **graph state** which tracks:\n",
    "- Node outputs\n",
    "- Variable values\n",
    "- Control flow decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you donâ€™t persist this state:\n",
    "- You cannot resume the graph from where it stopped\n",
    "- You lose all memory/context of what happened before\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”§ How is Persistence Implemented?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph provides **persistence interfaces** through:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `StateStore`:\n",
    "An interface for how states are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementations include:\n",
    "- `InMemoryStateStore`: Keeps everything in memory (good for testing)\n",
    "- `RedisStateStore`: Uses Redis for scalable, fault-tolerant persistence\n",
    "- `MongoDBStateStore`: Persists state in MongoDB\n",
    "- Custom backends: You can define your own `StateStore`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `graph.persist()`\n",
    "You call this method (or configure the graph) to make sure it writes state to the storage backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n",
    "from langgraph.storage import RedisStateStore\n",
    "\n",
    "store = RedisStateStore(url=\"redis://localhost:6379\")\n",
    "\n",
    "graph = StateGraph()\n",
    "graph.configure(persistence=store)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every step's state will be written to Redis.\n",
    "- If execution crashes or is paused, you can resume from last state.\n",
    "\n"

    "Each thread has:\n",
    "- Its own state\n",
